        <h1>Project Brief</h1>


        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>The project that I'm updating for the final is my MadLibs because although I'm really proud of how it came out, I do think there are some small tweaks to the design that could be improved</p>
    
    
        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>I mainly plan on focusing on the visual design. One of my peers mentioned that they'd like to see more variation in the graphics on the screen since currently a lot of them are just copies of each other. I was also struggling with the gradient background of my page repeating beyond the body of the page so I'm going to try to find a way to fix that or replace it with a simpler background. If time allows, I'd also like to do some usability testing to determine whether the timer mechanism I implemented has enough time to complete the form or if it should be shortened/lengthened.</p>
    
    
        <h2>Expert Feedback</h2>
        <p>For expert feedback, I think I'll consult the undergrad tutor and reach out to my Interactive Media I professor for advice on how I can make the visual design more interesting.</p>
