        <h1>Final Project Report</h1>


        <h2>About the Experts</h2>
        <p>My work was critiqued by our course tutor Samantha Mah. She has completed the Interactive Media series and as such is familiar with the requirements and sensiblities necessary for this project. If I had more time I would also reach out to my Interactive Media I professor, Lloyd Wheeler, for further insights.</p>
    
    
        <h2>Design notes</h2>
        <p>Sam commmented that my overall design was strong but there were small details that could be refined. She commented on the darkness of the lines of the main notepad being a factor in sensory overload when you first look at the page and suggested reducing their opacity to make them seem more like a subtle detail that complements the page rather than a design feature that distracts from the central functionality of the form.</p>
        <p>Sam also spotted some inconsistencies with the rounded corners of the timer and the overlays and recommended using the same border radius throughout to make the whole design feel more cohesive and unified. She also pointed out the the current background colors I had selected can make it challenging to read the text at the bottom of the page and that center aligning the buttons could make it feel more connected with the rest of the sections on the page which are all centered. A sketch of the changes I plan to make is as follows:</p>
