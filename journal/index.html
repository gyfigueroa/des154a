            <h2>Overlay Design Pattern Research</h2>
            
            <p>Naema Baskanderi's Medium article "Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows" was very helpful at locking down the essentials when it comes to designing an effective overlay. She carefully breaks down the anatomy of a modal and the Do's and Don'ts for each aspect. The one that stuck out the most to me was the idea that an overlay should never take up more than 50% of the screen's real estate. It's also very important to include clear, understandable labels on buttons, especially in cases where confusion may get stacked like trying to cancel or exit an overlay</p>
            <p>Baskanderi also provides additional insights for accessibility and into designing modals and overlays for a mobile view. In general, she advises against designs overlays on mobile devices due to their limited screen size and the easily "convolutable" nature of an overlay at that scale. There's also a section on Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) but mainly leaves it up to the reader to learn more about that!</p>

            <h2>Research Form Design</h2>
            
            <p>I really enjoyed reading Salim Ansari’s Medium article, “Best practices for form design,” because it provided me with a lot of ideas that I previously had never considered.  Ansari provides a lot of helpful tips for the general structure of forms, including the importance of a one column layout, minimizing the number of input fields, and organization techniques to reduce form abandonment. One of the things that I absorbed most was copy side of form design. There’s a very specific, neutral, docile style of writing that is the most effective at making sure people complete the forms. This is a very important skill for designers to practice as well. Sometimes I feel myself getting too lost in the visual side of creating that I forget how important language is as a vessel to teach people how to interact with our designs. </p>
            <p>A website that I think exemplifies best practices is Apple. I scrolled for a few minutes playing with all their very clean animations that they’ve become known for before I landed on the page for buying the latest iPad. They pretty much tick al the boxes of best practices from Ansari’s article but to list couple: they have helper texts and graphics for the more technical decisions; they list out options when there are under four and do drop down menus for longer selections; they use inline labels that transform into normal labels when you type into the field which is pretty satisfying to watch.</p>
